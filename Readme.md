For your task, here's a high-level step-by-step approach to guide you through the process. Since you've completed the `User` and `Invoice` models, we can now focus on the remaining tasks. Here's the overall flow:

### Step 1: Database Setup and CSV Data Import
1. **Prepare the database**:
   - Set up your database (PostgreSQL is a good option for handling large datasets). 
   - Run migrations to create the necessary tables from your models (`User`, `Invoice`).
   
2. **Create a CSV import function**:
   - Write a Django management command or a utility function that reads your CSV file and populates the `Invoice` model in the database. Use Django's `bulk_create` for efficient insertion.

### Step 2: API Endpoints (Django REST Framework)
3. **Install Django REST Framework (DRF)**:
   - Set up DRF to expose your backend functionalities as APIs.
   
4. **Create APIs**:
   - Implement the following APIs:
     - **Login/Logout API**: Use Django’s authentication system.
     - **Dashboard Data API**: Create endpoints to return aggregated sales, stock, and profit data for different filters (city, county, zip code, etc.).
     - **Invoice API**: Add the ability to add/update invoices.
     - **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error responses for exceptions (e.g., database update failures).

### Step 3: Frontend Development (React)
5. **Set up React**:
   - Create your React project and integrate with the Django backend APIs.
   - Install necessary libraries (e.g., Axios for API calls, React Router for navigation).

6. **Create Components**:
   - **Login Component**: For user authentication.
   - **Dashboard Component**: To display data from the dashboard API. Implement filtering capabilities (city, zip code, etc.).
   - **Invoice Component**: To add and update invoices via forms.

### Step 4: Dashboard Aggregation and Filtering Logic
7. **Write Aggregation Logic in the Backend**:
   - Implement Django queryset logic to group and aggregate data based on the requested filters (city, county, etc.). Use Django’s `annotate()` and `aggregate()` methods.
   
8. **Create Frontend Filters**:
   - Build UI components that allow users to select filters (city, county, etc.) and trigger API requests to update the dashboard dynamically.

### Step 5: Async Operations and Optimization
9. **Optimize Data Queries**:
   - For large datasets (625k rows), optimize your queries and use pagination when needed. Utilize Django’s `select_related()` and `prefetch_related()` for performance.
   
10. **Add Async Operations**:
    - Ensure that long-running tasks (e.g., CSV import) are run asynchronously using Django’s `celery` or `asyncio` to avoid blocking the server.

### Step 6: Dockerize the Application
11. **Create Docker Setup**:
    - Dockerize your application to run in containers (Django, PostgreSQL, React) for easy deployment.

### Step 7: Testing and Error Handling
12. **Unit Tests**:
    - Write tests for the backend APIs and ensure error handling in case of invalid input or database issues.
   
13. **Error Pages**:
    - Implement a frontend error page for cases where updates fail or unexpected errors occur.
